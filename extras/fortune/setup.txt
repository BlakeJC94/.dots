To add a new database to `fortune`, create a file `quotes` with the following:

```
Limits exist only in your mind!
%
"Maybe this world is another planet’s hell."
— Aldous Huxley
%
"Choices are the hinges of destiny." —Edwin Markham
%
“Sometimes it’s the smallest decisions that can
change your life forever." —Keri Russell
%
“We are the creative force of our life, and through our
own decisions rather than our conditions, if we carefully
learn to do certain things, we can accomplish
those goals.” —Stephen Covey
```

Generate headers datfile using `strfile`:

```bash
$ strfile -c % quotes quotes.dat
```

```bash
$ fortune quotes
